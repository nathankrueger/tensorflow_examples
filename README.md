# tensorflow_examples

This repository mostly captures my learning of the TensorFlow framework, and some common utilities for handling video and image data.

There exist a handful of scripts for downloading Ring camera videos, extracting frames and resizing images, and detecting similar images
by computing cosine similarity of feature vectors provided by a pretrained CNN.
